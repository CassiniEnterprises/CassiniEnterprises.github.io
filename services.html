                            In a year, shoplifting causes nearly $50 billion in losses in the U.S. alone. It would not
                            be an
                            exaggeration to say all shop owners should take steps to avoid this risk. For twenty years,
                            CK
                            Security Group has been guarding and ensuring the protection of some of the city’s most
                            notable
                            stores.

                            CK Security Group trains our guards with excellence and elegance. Our guards will not base
                            surveillance on people solely on their appearance. These methods are outdated, dishonorable,
                            and
                            most importantly, ineffective. At CK Security, we value our guards being trained with the
                            most
                            effective methods available, in order to make you and your customers feel safer.

                            deciding where to call home; nothing will make tenants feel safer than one of our trained

                            your property value as well. New York has the most beautiful buildings in the world, let us
